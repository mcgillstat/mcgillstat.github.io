      <description>Date: 2023-09-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/86404798712 Meeting ID: 864 0479 8712 Passcode: None Abstract: Causal mediation techniques are a means for identifying the degree to which a cause influences its effect along particular causal paths. For example, in a model where a cause influences its effect both indirectly via a mediator and directly via factors not included in the model, mediation techniques enable one to measure both direct and indirect effects.</description>

      <description>Date: 2023-08-17 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Hybrid: In person / Zoom Location: Burnside Hall 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/89623344755?pwd=S1E0QWVjSm8wRHdIYU5IZzllSXNjUT09 Meeting ID: 896 2334 4755 Passcode: 287381 Abstract: In sparse large-scale testing problems where the false discovery proportion (FDP) is highly variable, the false discovery exceedance (FDX) provides a valuable alternative to the widely used false discovery rate (FDR). We develop an empirical Bayes approach to controlling the FDX. We show that for independent hypotheses from a two-group model and dependent hypotheses from a Gaussian model fulfilling the exchangeability condition, an oracle decision rule based on ranking and thresholding the local false discovery rate (lfdr) is optimal in the sense that the power is maximized subject to FDX constraint.</description>

Our goal is to estimate the associated Euclidean copula parameter given a sample of the response and the covariate.</description>

      <description>Date: 2023-03-24 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) On Zoom only https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/83436686293?pwd=b0RmWmlXRXE3OWR6NlNIcWF5d0dJQT09 Meeting ID: 834 3668 6293 Passcode: 12345 Abstract: Causal discovery procedures are popular methods for discovering causal structure across the physical, biological, and social sciences. However, most procedures for causal discovery only output a single estimated causal model or single equivalence class of models. We propose a procedure for quantifying uncertainty in causal discovery. Specifically, we consider linear structural equation models with non-Gaussian errors and propose a procedure which returns a confidence sets of causal orderings which are not ruled out by the data.</description>

Though it has been well-studied for high-dimensional sparse PCA, little is known when the noise is heteroskedastic, which turns out to be ubiquitous in many scenarios, like biological sequencing data and information network data.</description>

This necessitates the development of models that can simultaneously handle both the network peer-effect (arising from neighborhood interactions) and the effect of (possibly) high-dimensional covariates.</description>

Compartmental models, such as the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR), are the most popular tools for this task. They have been used extensively to combat many infectious disease outbreaks including the current COVID-19 pandemic. One downside of these models is that they assume that the dynamics of an epidemic follow a pre-defined dynamical system which may not capture the true trajectories of an outbreak.</description>

Under the label shift context, the marginal distribution of the label varies across the training and testing datasets, while the conditional distribution of features given the label is the same. Traditional label shift adaptation methods either suffer from large estimation errors or require cumbersome post-prediction calibrations.</description>

However, in a number of settings, we may be concerned that our training sample is biased, and that some groups (characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes) may be under- or over-represented relative to the general population; and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment.</description>

Its core component is called &amp;ldquo;genetically regulated expression (GReX)&amp;rdquo;. GReX links gene expression information with phenotype by serving as both the outcome of genotype-based expression models and the predictor for downstream association testing. Although it is popular and has been used in many high-profile projects, its mathematical nature and interpretation haven’t been rigorously verified.</description>

However, despite its prevalence, theoretical guidance regarding its use is still lacking. In this talk we will explore two examples and establish an asymptotic theory for it. In the first part of this talk, we study the cross-validation method, a ubiquitous method for risk estimation, and establish its asymptotic properties for a large class of models and with an arbitrary number of folds.</description>

We tackle the challenge by proposing a novel one-pass estimator based on penalized orthogonal basis expansions and developing a general framework to study the interplay between statistical efficiency and memory consumption of estimators.</description>

The bounds can be further tightened by conditioning on pre-treatment covariates, and the sharp version of the bounds corresponds to using a full covariate vector. This paper gives a method for estimation and inference on sharp bounds determined by a linear system of under-identified equalities (e.</description>

Such models are usually modular so that high-dimensional distributions can be described and handled by careful combination of lower dimensional factors. Furthermore, graphs are natural data structures for algorithmic treatment. Moreover, graphical models can allow for causal interpretation, often provided through a recursive system on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and the max-linear Bayesian network we introduced in [1] is a specific example.</description>

Such a testing problem is related to transfer learning and causal inference. We develop a nonparametric procedure by combining recent advances in conformal prediction with some new ingredients such as a novel choice of conformity score and data-driven choices of weight and score functions.</description>

The long term goal of causal representation learning is to find appropriate assumptions and methods to disentangle latent variables and learn the causal mechanisms that explain a system&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.</description>

In contrast to conventional approaches, we employ kernel convolution to smooth the original loss function. The coefficient function is estimated under a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework. A gradient descent algorithm is designed to minimize the smoothed loss function with a roughness penalty.</description>

Every performance includes mistakes—intonation issues, a lost note, an unpleasant sound—but these are all easily forgotten (or unnoticed) when a performer engages her audience, imbuing a piece with novel emotional content beyond the vague instructions inscribed on the printed page.</description>

In the last two decades regularisation approaches have become the methods of choice for analysing high dimensional data. However, obtaining accurate estimates and predictions as well as valid statistical inference remains a major challenge in high dimensional situations.</description>

The framework addresses, among other examples, false discovery rate control in multi-label classification, intersection-over-union control in instance segmentation, and the simultaneous control of the type-1 error of outlier detection and confidence set coverage in classification or regression.</description>

Many popular methods, such as holdout methods, cross-validation methods, and conformal prediction, are able to provide distribution-free guarantees for predictive inference, but the problem of providing inference for the underlying regression function (for example, inference on the conditional mean E[Y|X]) is more challenging.</description>

We propose two new approaches to quantify uncertainty in optimal treatment regime estimation. First, we consider inference in the model-free setting, which does not require specifying an outcome regression model. Existing model-free estimators for optimal treatment regimes are usually not suitable for the purpose of inference, because they either have nonstandard asymptotic distributions or do not necessarily guarantee consistent estimation of the parameter indexing the Bayes rule due to the use of surrogate loss.</description>

Although those unimodal measurements had brought success for studies in a large variety of studies, the incomplete (and often misleading) unimodal cellular profiling could lead to biased and inaccurate conclusions.</description>

Most of the existing works assume no unmeasured variables exist that confound the observed actions. This assumption, however, is likely to be violated in real applications such as healthcare and technological industries.</description>

The bundling feature naturally leads to longitudinal measurements of multiple insurance risks. We build a novel predictive model that actively exploits the dependence among the evolution of multivariate repeated risk measurements.</description>

In variational Bayes (VB), a method from machine learning, one approximates the posterior through optimization, which is typically faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo. We study a mean-field (i.e. factorizable) VB approximation to Bayesian model selection priors, including the popular spike-and-slab prior, in sparse high-dimensional linear regression.</description>

To analyze them properly, we must address the fact that the treatment is assigned at the cluster level instead of the individual level. Standard analytic strategies are regressions based on individual data, cluster averages, and cluster totals, which differ when the cluster sizes vary.</description>

With a simple illustrative dataset, we first demonstrate how the traditional tree-based algorithm&amp;rsquo;s splitting function fails to cope with a large proportion of data with zero responses.</description>

Unlike classical methods which are based on estimating the (limiting) distribution of an estimator, the HulC is often simpler to use and effectively bypasses this step. In comparison to the bootstrap, the HulC requires fewer regularity conditions and succeeds in many examples where the bootstrap provably fails.</description>

Classical empirical processes typically study the empirical distribution function over the real line, while more modern empirical processes study much more general indexing function classes (e.g., Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, smoothness class); typical results include moment bounds and deviation inequalities.</description>

Understanding the dependencies among such multivariate risks is essential for the solvency and profitability of insurers. Effectively modeling insurance claim data is challenging due to their special complexities. At the policyholder level, claims data usually follow a two-part mixed distribution: a probability mass at zero corresponding to no claim and an otherwise positive claim from a skewed and long-tailed distribution.</description>

In this talk, I will consider the problem of learning (estimating) a causal graphical model from data. The search over possible directed acyclic graphs modeling the causal structure is inherently combinatorial, but I&amp;rsquo;ll describe our recent work which use gradient-based continuous optimization for learning both the parameters of the distribution and the causal graph jointly, and can be combined naturally with flexible parametric families that use neural networks.</description>

Under a linear bandit framework with high-dimensional covariates, we propose a general arm allocation algorithm that integrates both arm elimination and randomized assignment strategies. By employing a class of high-dimensional regression methods for coefficient estimation, the proposed algorithm is shown to have near optimal finite-time regret performance under a new study scope that requires neither a margin condition nor a reward gap condition for competitive arms.</description>

So far, quasi-random number generators for multivariate distributions required a careful design, exploiting specific properties (such as conditional distributions) of the implied copula or the underlying quasi-Monte Carlo point set, and were only tractable for a small number of models.</description>

These models combine two trained components: a base distribution (generally an implicit model), which can learn the support of data with low intrinsic dimension in a high dimensional space; and an energy function, to refine the probability mass on the learned support. Both the energy function and base jointly constitute the final model, unlike GANs, which retain only the base distribution (the &amp;ldquo;generator&amp;rdquo;).</description>

Despite its wide range of applications in many areas, such as social sciences and health-related research, the problem has not been well-studied in statistics so far. Previous methods either lack of inference tools or rely on restrictive assumptions on social effects, and usually treat the network structure as precisely observed, which is too good to be true in many problems.</description>

Adaptive MCMC attempts to automatically modify the algorithm while it runs, to improve its performance on the fly. However, such adaptation often destroys the ergodicity properties necessary for the algorithm to be valid.</description>

Yet a simple fundamental question of how to precisely quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the identification of latent links still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the method of statistical inference on membership profiles in large networks (SIMPLE) in the setting of degree-corrected mixed membership model, where the null hypothesis assumes that the pair of nodes share the same profile of community memberships.</description>

This code solves a complicated system of equations representing the underlying science of the problem. Such simulations can be very time-intensive, requiring months of computation for a single run. Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used as predictive models for “emulating” this expensive computer code.</description>

      <description>Date: 2020-03-27 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURNSIDE 1205 Abstract: Generalized structured component analysis (GSCA) was developed as a component-based approach to structural equation modeling, where constructs are represented by components or weighted composites of observed variables, rather than (common) factors. Unlike another long-lasting component-based approach – partial least squares path modeling, GSCA is a full-information method that optimizes a single criterion to estimate model parameters simultaneously, utilizing all information available in the entire system of equations.</description>

Under the Bayesian framework incorporation of information obtained from any source other than the current data is facilitated through construction of an informative prior. The existing methodology for defining an informative prior based on historical data relies on measuring similarity to the current data at the study level that can result in discarding useful individual patient data (IPD).</description>

These introduce a rising need for exploratory analysis to reveal and understand hidden structure in the collected (high-dimensional) Big Data. A crucial aspect in such analysis is the separation of intrinsic data geometry from data distribution, as (a) the latter is typically biased by collection artifacts and data availability, and (b) rare subpopulations and sparse transitions between meta-stable states are often of great interest in biomedical data analysis.</description>

The new families are constructed from existing copulas by first transforming their margins to standard Gaussian distributions, then transforming these variables into non-central chi-square variables with one degree of freedom, and finally by considering the copula associated with these new variables.</description>

However, it remains challenging for the operators to charge the fleet due to limited or costly access to charging facilities. In this work, we focus on answering the core question - how to charge the fleet to make EV sharing viable and profitable. Our work is motivated by the recent setback that struck San Diego, California, where car2go ceased its EV sharing operations.</description>

This task is complicated by the presence of &amp;ldquo;confounders&amp;rdquo; that influence both treatment and outcome, inducing observed associations that are not causal. Causal estimation is achieved by adjusting for this confounding by using observed covariate information.

In the first part of this talk, I will consider the problem of estimating a neuron&amp;rsquo;s spike times from calcium imaging data.

      <description>Date: 2019-11-29 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: An Euler discretization of the Langevin diffusion is known to converge to the global minimizers of certain convex and non-convex optimization problems. We show that this property holds for any suitably smooth diffusion and that different diffusions are suitable for optimizing different classes of convex and non-convex functions. This allows us to design diffusions suitable for globally optimizing convex and non-convex functions not covered by the existing Langevin theory.</description>

We introduce a family of logarithmic divergences which is a non-linear extension of the celebrated Bregman divergence. It is defined for any exponentially concave function (a function whose exponential is concave). We motivate this divergence by mathematical finance and large deviations of Dirichlet process.</description>

Simultaneously testing a large number of general linear hypotheses, such as multiple contrasts, based on the large scale multivariate regression reveals a variety of associations between responses and regression or experimental factors. Traditional multiple testing methods often ignore the effect of heavy-tailedness in the data and impose joint normality assumption that is arguably stringent in applications.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-10-18 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In its most common form extreme value theory is concerned with the limiting distribution of location-scale transformed block-maxima $M_n = \max(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ of a sequence of identically distributed random variables $(X_i)$, $i\geq 1$. In case the members of the sequence $(X_i)$ are independent, the weak limiting behaviour of $M_n$ is adequately described by the classical Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem. In this presentation we are interested in the case of dependent random variables $(X_i)$ while retaining a common marginal distribution function $F$ for all $X_i$, $i\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

Monte-Carlo type methods arise naturally when one looks forward to quantifying/controlling the error.

Specifically, I present a functional concurrent linear model (FLCM) with varying coefficients for two-dimensional spatial images. To address overparameterization issues, the parameter surfaces in this model are transformed into the wavelet domain and then sparse representations are found using two different methods: LASSO and Bayesian variable selection.</description>

The common feature of the proposed estimation procedures in the literature is that they only put probability mass on failure times. Under length-biased sampling, however, censoring is informative and failing to incorporate censored observations into estimation can lead to a substantial loss of efficiency.</description>

Representative examples of real-world graphs include social networks, user-item networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and molecular structures, which are represented as graphs. In this talk, I will introduce our work on learning effective representations of graphs such as learning low-dimensional node representations of large graphs (e.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-04-12 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURNSIDE 1205 Abstract: Advances in wearables and digital technology now make it possible to deliver behavioral, mobile health, interventions to individuals in their every-day life. The micro-randomized trial (MRT) is increasingly used to provide data to inform the construction of these interventions. This work is motivated by multiple MRTs that have been conducted or are currently in the field in which the primary outcome is a longitudinal binary outcome.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-04-05 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURNSIDE 1104 Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effects is crucial for individualized or precision medicine. In reality, however, there is no way to obtain both the treated and untreated outcomes from the same person at the same time. An approximation can be obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Despite the limitations that randomizations are usually expensive, impractical or unethical, pre-specified variables may still not fully incorporate all the relevant characteristics capturing individual heterogeneity in treatment response.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-03-29 Time: 13:00-16:30 Location: McIntyre &amp;ndash; Room 521 Abstract: Classical statistics often makes assumptions about conditional independence in order to fit models but in the modern world connectivity is key. Nowadays we need to account for many dependencies and sometimes the associations and dependencies themselves are the key items of interest e.g. how do we predict conflict between countries, how can we use friendships between school children to choose the best groups for study tips/help, how does the pattern of needle-sharing among partners correlate to HIV transmission and where interventions can best be made.</description>

The network operators are also able to collect more data to improve network performance and user experience. In this paper we concentrate on modeling performance of wireless cells using hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework. This framework provides a principled way to navigate the space between the option of creating one model to represent all cells in a network and the option of creating separate models at each cell.</description>

Motivated by cell lineage tracking experiments to study hematopoiesis (the process of blood cell production), we present recent methodology enabling likelihood-based inference for partially observed data arising from continuous-time branching processes. These computational advances allow principled procedures such as maximum likelihood estimation, posterior inference, and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms in previously intractable data settings.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-02-22 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A confidence sequence is a sequence of confidence intervals that is uniformly valid over an unbounded time horizon. In this paper, we develop non-asymptotic confidence sequences under nonparametric conditions that achieve arbitrary precision. Our technique draws a connection between the classical Cramer-Chernoff method, the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL), and the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)—our confidence sequences extend the first to produce time-uniform concentration bounds, provide tight non-asymptotic characterizations of the second, and generalize the third to nonparametric settings, including sub-Gaussian and Bernstein conditions, self-normalized processes, and matrix martingales.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-02-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Causal inference is a challenging problem because causation cannot be established from observational data alone. Researchers typically rely on additional sources of information to infer causation from association. Such information may come from powerful designs such as randomization, or background knowledge such as information on all confounders. However, perfect designs or background knowledge required for establishing causality may not always be available in practice.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-25 Time: 16:00-17:00 Location: BURN 920 Abstract: We have witnessed a lot of exciting development of data science in recent years. From the perspective of optimization, many modern data-science problems involve some basic ``non’’-properties that lack systematic treatment by the current approaches for the sake of the computation convenience. These non-properties include the coupling of the non-convexity, non-differentiability and non-determinism. In this talk, we present rigorous computational methods for solving two typical non-problems: the piecewise linear regression and the feed-forward deep neural network.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-18 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Non-singularity of the information matrix plays a key role in model identification and the asymptotic theory of statistics. For many statistical models, however, this condition seems virtually impossible to verify. An example of such models is a class of mixture models associated with multi-path change-point problems (MCP) which can model longitudinal data with change points. The MCP models are similar in nature to mixture-of-experts models in machine learning.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-11 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Cross-validation (CV) is perhaps the most widely used tool for tuning supervised machine learning algorithms in order to achieve better generalization error rate. In this paper, we focus on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for the support vector machine (SVM) and related algorithms. We first address two wide-spreading misconceptions on LOOCV. We show that LOOCV, ten-fold, and five-fold CV are actually well-matched in estimating the generalization error, and the computation speed of LOOCV is not necessarily slower than that of ten-fold and five-fold CV.</description>

Rather, the goal is to address the topic of the talk title through a 2017 multi-authored paper published in Nature Human Behaviour. The Nature article proposes that the standard cut-off significance level of .05 should be replaced by a cut-off level of .005 when new discoveries are being claimed. The authors attribute the high proportion of irreducible results in the literature that accompany claimed new discoveries, in part, to the low-bar cut-off of .</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-11-16 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1104 Abstract: The median residual lifetime function is a statistical quantity which describes the future point in time at which the probability of current survival has dropped by 50%. In deriving an estimator for the median residual lifetime function for length-biased data, the added features of left-truncation and right-censoring must be taken into account.
In this talk, we give a brief description of length-biased failure time data and show that by using a particular non-parametric estimator for the survival function that it is possible to derive the asymptotically most-efficient non-parametric estimator for the median residual lifetime function.</description>

We examine two different types of random fragmentation-coalescent models which produce somewhat unexpected results.
The first concerns an agent-based model in which, with a rate that depends on the configuration of the system, agents coalesce into clusters that also fragment into their individual constituent membership.</description>

I will then talk about a detailed example on imaging genetics. In this project, we develop a high-dimensional matrix linear regression model to correlate 2D imaging responses with high-dimensional genetic covariates. We propose a fast and efficient screening procedure based on the spectral norm to deal with the case that the dimension of scalar covariates is much larger than the sample size.</description>

In this talk I will describe some recent progress in characterizing the convergence behavior of mixing distributions when one fits a mixture model to the data. This theory hinges on the relationship between the space of mixture densities, which is endowed with variational or Hellinger distance, and the space of mixing measures endowed with optimal transport distance metrics.</description>

We propose a new matching approach based on the reduced covariates obtained from sufficient dimension reduction. Compared with the original covariates and the propensity scores, which are commonly used for matching in the literature, the reduced covariates are estimable nonparametrically and are effective in imputing the missing potential outcomes.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-09-28 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Constructing an optimal dynamic treatment regime become complex when there are large number of prognostic factors, such as patient’s genetic information, demographic characteristics, medical history over time. Existing methods only focus on selecting the important variables for the decision-making process and fall short in providing inference for the selected model. We fill this gap by leveraging the conditional selective inference methodology. We show that the proposed method is asymptotically valid given certain rate assumptions in semiparametric regression.</description>

Our method organizes basketball possessions by offensive structure. We first develop a model for populating a dictionary of short, repeated, and spatially registered actions. Each action corresponds to an interpretable type of player movement. We examine statistical patterns in these actions, and show how they can be used to describe individual player behavior.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-09-14 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1104 Abstract: Nonparametric models are popular modeling tools because of their natural overall flexibility. In our approach, we apply nonparametric techniques for panel data structures with changepoints and optional shape constraints and the estimation is performed in a fully data driven manner by utilizing atomic pursuit methods – LASSO regularization techniques in particular. However, in order to obtain robust estimates and, also, to have a more complex insight into the underlying data structure, we target conditional quantiles rather then the conditional mean only.</description>

The cause-specific hazard functions are assumed to follow Cox proportional hazard models, and the associations between failure times given the same or different cause events and the associations between occurrences of competing risk events within the same cluster are investigated through copula models.</description>

We used cohort data with full information including the exact date of the nosocomial infection and mimicked an artificial one-day prevalence study by picking a sample from this cohort study. Based on the cohort data, we studied the underlying multi-state model which accounts for nosocomial infection as an intermediate and discharge/death as competing events.</description>

Syncytial clustering is the name that we introduce for methods that merge groups obtained from standard clustering algorithms in order to reveal complex group structure in the data. Here, we develop a distribution-free fully-automated syncytial algorithm that can be used with the computationally efficient k-means or other algorithms.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-04-06 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: With modern technology development, functional responses are observed frequently in various scientific fields including neuroimaging data analysis. Empirical likelihood as a nonparametric data-driven technique has become an important statistical inference methodology. In this paper, motivated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data we propose three generalized empirical likelihood-based methods that accommodate within-curve dependence on the varying coefficient model with functional responses and embed a robust regression idea.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-03-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Computer experiments refer to the study of real systems using complex simulation models. They have been widely used as efficient, economical alternatives to physical experiments. Computer experiments with time series outputs are called dynamic computer experiments. In this talk, we consider two problems of such experiments: emulation of large-scale dynamic computer experiments and inverse problem. For the first problem, we proposed a computationally efficient modelling approach which sequentially finds a set of local design points based on a new criterion specifically designed for emulating dynamic computer simulators.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-03-16 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Over the last decade, advances in measurement technologies has enabled researchers to generate multiple types of high-dimensional &amp;ldquo;omics&amp;rdquo; datasets for large cohorts. These data provide an opportunity to derive a mechanistic understanding of human complex traits. However, inferring meaningful biological relationships from these data is challenging due to high-dimensionality , noise, and abundance of confounding factors. In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe statistical approaches for robust analysis of genomic data from large population studies, with a focus on 1) understanding the nature of confounding and approaches for addressing them and 2) understanding the genomic correlates of aging and dementia.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-02-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Sparse penalized quantile regression is a useful tool for variable selection, robust estimation, and heteroscedasticity detection in high-dimensional data analysis. We discuss the variable selection and estimation properties of the lasso and folded concave penalized quantile regression via non-asymptotic arguments. We also consider consistent parameter tuning therein. The computational issue of the sparse penalized quantile regression has not yet been fully resolved in the literature, due to non-smoothness of the quantile regression loss function.</description>

After diagnosis, the intensive treatment phase for MDR-TB involves taking several alternative antibiotics concurrently. The Collaborative Group for Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data in MDR-TB has assembled a large, fused dataset of over 30 observational studies comparing the effectiveness of 15 antibiotics.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-02-02 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A new process, the factorial hidden Markov volatility (FHMV) model, is proposed to model financial returns or realized variances. This process is constructed based on a factorial hidden Markov model structure and corresponds to a parsimoniously parametrized hidden Markov model that includes thousands of volatility states. The transition probability matrix of the underlying Markov chain is structured so that the multiplicity of its second largest eigenvalue can be greater than one.</description>

Our approach is based on combining structure-inducing and sparsity penalties in a single regression problem. It allows for the use of a large family of structure-inducing penalties: Those characterized by semi-norm constraints. This includes finite dimensional linear subspaces, sobolev and holder classes, classes with bounded total variation, among others.</description>

      <description>Date: 2018-01-12 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: The key determinant of the identity and behaviour of the cell is gene regulation, i.e. which genes are active and which genes are inactive in a particular cell. One of the least understood aspects of gene regulation is RNA stability: genes produce RNA molecules to carry their genetic information – the more stable these RNA molecules are, the longer they can function within the cell, and the less stable they are, the more rapidly they are removed from the pool of active molecules.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-12-01 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Fisher’s method, also known as Fisher’s combined probability test, is commonly used in meta-analyses to combine p-values from the same test applied to K independent samples to evaluate a common null hypothesis. Here we propose to use it to combine p-values from different tests applied to the same sample in two settings: when jointly analyzing multiple genetic variants in set-based genetic association studies, or when jointly capturing main and interaction effects in the presence of missing one of the interacting variables.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-11-17 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Changepoint detection is a central problem in time series and genomic data. For some applications, it is natural to impose constraints on the directions of changes. One example is ChIP-seq data, for which adding an up-down constraint improves peak detection accuracy, but makes the optimization problem more complicated. In this talk I will explain how a recently proposed functional pruning algorithm can be generalized to solve such constrained changepoint detection problems.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-11-10 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: One of the defining properties of deep learning is that models are chosen to have many more parameters than available training data. In light of this capacity for overfitting, it is remarkable that simple algorithms like SGD reliably return solutions with low test error. One roadblock to explaining these phenomena in terms of implicit regularization, structural properties of the solution, and/or easiness of the data is that many learning bounds are quantitatively vacuous when applied to networks learned by SGD in this &amp;ldquo;deep learning&amp;rdquo; regime.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-10-27 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In many current applications, scientists can easily measure a very large number of variables (for example, hundreds of protein levels), some of which are expected be useful to explain or predict a specific response variable of interest. These potential explanatory variables are most likely to contain redundant or irrelevant information, and in many cases, their quality and reliability may be suspect. We developed two penalized robust regression estimators that can be used to identify a useful subset of explanatory variables to predict the response, while protecting the resulting estimator against possible aberrant observations in the data set.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-10-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Statistical optimization has generated quite some interest recently. It refers to the case where hidden and local convexity can be discovered in most cases for nonconvex problems, making polynomial algorithms possible. It relies on a careful analysis of the geometry near global optima. In this talk, I will explore this issue by focusing on sparse regression problems in high dimensions. A computational framework named iterative local adaptive majorize-minimization (I-LAMM) will be proposed to simultaneously control algorithmic complexity and statistical error.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-09-22 Time: 14:00-15:00 Location: BRONF179 Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric dependence detection. Many existing methods suffer severe power loss due to non-uniform consistency, which we illustrate with a paradox. To avoid such power loss, we approach the nonparametric test of independence through the new framework of binary expansion statistics (BEStat) and binary expansion testing (BET), which examine dependence through a filtration induced by marginal binary expansions. Through a novel decomposition of the likelihood of contingency tables whose sizes are powers of 2, we show that the interactions of binary variables in the filtration are complete sufficient statistics for dependence.</description>

Initially, the various business and engineering needs led to a multitude of forecasting approaches, most reliant on direct analyst support. The volume and variety of the approaches, and in some cases their inconsistency, called out for an attempt to unify, automate, and extend forecasting methods, and to distribute the results via tools that could be deployed reliably across the company.</description>

Large-scale sequencing experiments provide fantastic opportunities to learn about human history and biology if we can overcome computational and statistical challenges.

To facilitate the computational process, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big data. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable segments; the final output is then aggregated from the individual outputs of the segments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that whether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to the original data; if so, how efficient does it work?</description>

The problem may be formulated formally in statistical terms. The most frequently used methods are based on the required size, and power of the trial for a specified treatment effect. In contrast to the Bayesian decision-theoretic approach, there is no explicit balancing of the cost of a possible increase in the size of the trial against the benefit of the more accurate information which it would give.</description>

It’s a powerful sensory system that can detect stress levels, infections, wounds, and even cancer tumors. However, due to the complex interplay between different cell types and signaling pathways, the amount of data produced to characterize all different aspects of the immune system (tens of thousands of genes measured and hundreds of millions of cells, just from a single patient) completely overwhelms existing bioinformatics tools.</description>

In this article, we propose the sparse envelope model, which is motivated by applications where some response variables are invariant to changes of the predictors and have zero regression coefficients. The envelope estimator is consistent but not sparse, and in many situations it is important to identify the response variables for which the regression coefficients are zero.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-01-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Finite mixture models provide a natural framework for analyzing data from heterogeneous populations. In practice, however, the number of hidden subpopulations in the data may be unknown. The problem of estimating the order of a mixture model, namely the number of subpopulations, is thus crucial for many applications. In this talk, we present a new penalized likelihood solution to this problem, which is applicable to models with a multidimensional parameter space.</description>

      <description>Date: 2017-01-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Many popular statistical models for network valued datasets fall under the remit of the graphon framework, which (implicitly) assumes the networks are densely connected. However, this assumption rarely holds for the real-world networks of practical interest. We introduce a new class of models for random graphs that generalises the dense graphon models to the sparse graph regime, and we argue that this meets many of the desiderata one would demand of a model to serve as the foundation for a statistical analysis of real-world networks.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-12-02 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: The aim of this talk is to present a statistical framework for the analysis of dependent bivariate multistate processes, allowing one to study the dependence both across subjects in a pair and among individual-specific events. As for the latter, copula- based models are employed, whereas dependence between multi-state models can be accomplished by means of frailties. The well known Marshall-Olkin Bivariate Exponential Distribution (MOBVE) is considered for the joint distribution of frailties.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-11-25 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In the analysis of most spatio-temporal processes in environmental studies, observations present skewed distributions. Usually, a single transformation of the data is used to approximate normality, and stationary Gaussian processes are assumed to model the transformed data. The choice of transformation is key for spatial interpolation and temporal prediction. We propose a spatio-temporal model for skewed data that does not require the use of data transformation.</description>

Theoretical investigations have shown that functions obtained as deep compositions of simpler functions (which includes both deep and recurrent nets) can express highly varying functions (with many ups and downs and different input regions that can be distinguished) much more efficiently (with fewer parameters) than otherwise, under a prior which seems to work well for artificial intelligence tasks.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-11-11 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Given a data set, Tyler&amp;rsquo;s M-estimator is a widely used covariance matrix estimator with robustness to outliers or heavy-tailed distribution. We will discuss two recent results of this estimator. First, we show that when a certain percentage of the data points are sampled from a low-dimensional subspace, Tyler&amp;rsquo;s M-estimator can be used to recover the subspace exactly. Second, in the high-dimensional regime that the number of samples n and the dimension p both go to infinity, p/n converges to a constant y between 0 and 1, and when the data samples are identically and independently generated from the Gaussian distribution N(0,I), we showed that the difference between the sample covariance matrix and a scaled version of Tyler&amp;rsquo;s M-estimator tends to zero in spectral norm, and the empirical spectral densities of both estimators converge to the Marcenko-Pastur distribution.</description>

Bayesian nonparametrics are tools of choice to handle such datasets given their ability to share information across groups. In this presentation, we will compare three popular Bayesian nonparametric methods on the modeling of survival functions coming from related heterogeneous groups.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the bootstrap and permutation tests, and discussed how they may be used to help clients understand statistical results. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about accuracy &amp;ndash; there are dramatic differences in how accurate different bootstrap methods are. Surprisingly, the most common bootstrap methods are less accurate than classical methods for small samples, and more accurate for larger samples.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-10-21 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Multi-level hierarchical clustered data are commonly seen in financial and biostatistics applications. In this talk, we introduce several modeling strategies for describing the dependent relationships for members within a cluster or between different clusters (in the same or different levels). In particular we will apply the hierarchical Kendall copula, first proposed by Brechmann (2014), to model two-level hierarchical clustered survival data. This approach provides a clever way of dimension reduction in modeling complicated multivariate data.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-10-14 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Building on the work of Schwartz, Gelfand and Miranda (Statistics in Medicine (2010); 29(16), 1710-23), we propose a Bayesian finite mixture of bivariate regressions model for causal mediation analyses. Using an identifiability condition within each component of the mixture, we express the natural direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome as functions of the component-specific regression coefficients. On the basis of simulated data, we examine the behaviour of the model for estimating these effects in situations where the associations between exposure, mediator and outcome are confounded, or not.</description>

Within a partition, a majority vote is used. Suppose furthermore that this tree must be constructed recursively by implementing just two functions, so that the construction can be carried out in parallel by using &amp;ldquo;cells&amp;rdquo;: first of all, given input data, a cell must decide whether it will become a leaf or internal node in the tree.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-09-30 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Much theoretical and applied work has been devoted to high-dimensional regression with clean data. However, we often face corrupted data in many applications where missing data and measurement errors cannot be ignored. Loh and Wainwright (2012) proposed a non-convex modification of the Lasso for doing high-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data. It is generally agreed that the virtues of convexity contribute fundamentally the success and popularity of the Lasso.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-09-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: We revisit the problem of estimating the intensity parameter of a homogeneous Poisson point process observed in a bounded window of $R^d$ making use of a (now) old idea going back to James and Stein. For this, we prove an integration by parts formula for functionals defined on the Poisson space. This formula extends the one obtained by Privault and Réveillac (Statistical inference for Stochastic Processes, 2009) in the one-dimensional case and is well-suited to a notion of derivative of Poisson functionals which satisfy the chain rule.</description>

The equality constraints imposed on the weight coefficients are in line with the approach to interpreting the canonical variates (i.e., the linear combinations of original variables) advocated by Harris (1975, 1989), Rencher (1988, 1992), and Rencher and Christensen (2003).</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-04-08 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: For testing two random vectors for independence, we consider testing whether the distance of one vector from an arbitrary center point is independent from the distance of the other vector from an arbitrary center point by a univariate test. We provide conditions under which it is enough to have a consistent univariate test of independence on the distances to guarantee that the power to detect dependence between the random vectors increases to one, as the sample size increases.</description>

In addition to looking at the bias and asymptotic normality of the estimators, I will present results from a simulation study which shows that the kernel density estimator and the binned kernel density estimator have the same behavior and both estimate accurately the true density when the number of fields increases.</description>

In particular we find conditions on the shrinkage factor under which Stein-type shrinkage estimators dominate the usual minimax best equivariant estimator. In problems where the scale is known, minimax shrinkage factors which generally depend on both the loss and the sampling distribution are found.</description>

We introduce two strategies for constructing tractable nonparametric graphical model families. One approach is through semiparametric extension of the Gaussian or exponential family graphical models that allows arbitrary graphs. Another approach is to restrict the family of allowed graphs to be acyclic, enabling the use of fully nonparametric density estimation in high dimensions.</description>

Archimedean copulas are very popular and their extensions, nested Archimedean copulas, are well suited for vectors of random vectors in high dimension. I will describe a simple approach which makes it possible to compute the CDF of the sum or a variety of other functions of those random variables.</description>

The foundations of this subject were motivated by physicists interested in the properties of one-dimensional models that represented some form of physical phenomenon. By taking physical models and generalizing them into abstract mathematical terms, macroscopic properties about the model could be determined from the microscopic level.</description>

      <description>Date: 2016-02-05 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1214 Abstract: Estimating causal exposure effects in observational studies ideally requires the analyst to have a vast knowledge of the domain of application. Investigators often bypass difficulties related to the identification and selection of confounders through the use of fully adjusted outcome regression models. However, since such models likely contain more covariates than required, the variance of the regression coefficient for exposure may be unnecessarily large.</description>

Methods based on L1-regularization have been widely used for performing sparse selection in the graphical modelling context. However, the L1 penalty penalizes each edge equally and independently of each other without taking into account any structural information. We introduce a new method for estimating undirected graphical models with hubs, called the hubs weighted graphical lasso (HWGL).</description>

The problem of influential units is particularly important in business surveys, which collect economic variables, whose distribution are highly skewed (heavy right tail). In this talk, we will attempt to answer the following questions:
(1) What is an influential value in surveys? (2) How measure the influence of unit?</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-11-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Logistic or other constraints often preclude the possibility of conducting incident cohort studies. A feasible alternative in such cases is to conduct a cross-sectional prevalent cohort study for which we recruit prevalent cases, i.e., subjects who have already experienced the initiating event, say the onset of a disease. When the interest lies in estimating the lifespan between the initiating event and a terminating event, say death for instance, such subjects may be followed prospectively until the terminating event or loss to follow-up, whichever happens first.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-11-06 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Most regression models in biostatistics assume identifiability, which means that each point in the parameter space corresponds to a unique likelihood function for the observable data. Recently there has been interest in Bayesian inference for non-identifiable models, which can better represent uncertainty in some contexts. One example is in the field of epidemiology, where the investigator is concerned with bias due to unmeasured confounders (omitted variables).</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-10-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Finite mixture regression models have been widely used for modeling mixed regression relationships arising from a clustered and thus heterogenous population. The classical normal mixture model, despite of its simplicity and wide applicability, may fail dramatically in the presence of severe outliers. We propose a robust mixture regression approach based on a sparse, case-specific, and scale-dependent mean-shift parameterization, for simultaneously conducting outlier detection and robust parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-10-16 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Gaussian graphical models represent a good tool for capturing interactions between nodes represent the underlying random variables. However, in many applications in biology one is interested in modeling associations both between, as well as within molecular compartments (e.g., interactions between genes and proteins/metabolites). To this end, inferring multi-layered network structures from high-dimensional data provides insight into understanding the conditional relationships among nodes within layers, after adjusting for and quantifying the effects of nodes from other layers.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-10-09 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Spatio-temporal data are abundant in many scientific fields; examples include daily satellite images of the earth, hourly temperature readings from multiple weather stations, and the spread of an infectious disease over a particular region. In many instances the spatio-temporal data are accompanied by mathematical models expressed in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs). These PDEs determine the theoretical aspects of the behavior of the physical, chemical or biological phenomena considered.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-10-02 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In finance, the covariance matrix of many assets is a key component of financial portfolio optimization and is usually estimated from historical data. Much research in the past decade has focused on improving estimation by studying the asymptotics of large covariance matrices in the so-called high-dimensional regime, where the dimension p grows at the same pace as the sample size n, and this approach has been very successful.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-09-25 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: This talk addresses aspects of the statistical inference problem for the semiparametric elliptical copula model. The semiparametric elliptical copula model is the family of distributions whose dependence structures are specified by parametric elliptical copulas but whose marginal distributions are left unspecified. An elliptical copula is uniquely characterized by a characteristic generator and a copula correlation matrix Sigma. In the first part of this talk, I will consider the estimation of Sigma.</description>

Correspondingly, several algorithms have been developed for solving penalized high-dimensional models. I will describe fast and efficient unified algorithms for computing the solution path for a collection of penalized models. In particular, we will look at an algorithm for solving L1-penalized learning problems and an algorithm for solving group-lasso learning problems.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-09-11 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: The estimation of the extremal dependence structure of a multivariate extreme-value distribution is spoiled by the impact of the bias, which increases with the number of observations used for the estimation. Already known in the univariate setting, the bias correction procedure is studied in this talk under the multivariate framework. New families of estimators of the stable tail dependence function are obtained. They are asymptotically unbiased versions of the empirical estimator introduced by Huang (1992).</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-05-14 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A bivariate distribution can sometimes be characterized completely by properties of its conditional distributions. In this talk, we will discuss models of bivariate distributions whose conditionals are members of prescribed parametric families of distributions. Some relevant models with specified conditionals will be discussed, including the normal and lognormal cases, the skew-normal and other families of distributions. Finally, some conditionally specified densities will be shown to provide convenient flexible conjugate prior families in certain multiparameter Bayesian settings.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-03-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Networks provide a useful means to summarize sparse yet structured massive datasets, and so are an important aspect of the theory of big data. A key question in this setting is to test for the significance of community structure or what in social networks is termed homophily, the tendency of nodes to be connected based on similar characteristics. Network models where a single parameter per node governs the propensity of connection are popular in practice, because they are simple to understand and analyze.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-03-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Despite almost universal acceptance across most fields of statistics, Bayesian inferential methods have yet to breakthrough to widespread use in causal inference, despite Bayesian arguments being a core component of early developments in the field. Some quasi-Bayesian procedures have been proposed, but often these approaches rely on heuristic, sometimes flawed, arguments. In this talk I will discuss some formulations of classical causal inference problems from the perspective of standard Bayesian representations, and propose some inferential solutions.</description>

In particular, I will illustrate, using a variety of data sets, how COMPASS can reveal subtle and complex changes in antigen-specific T-cell activation profiles that correlate with biological endpoints. Applying COMPASS to data from the RV144 (“the Thai trial”) HIV clinical trial, it identified novel T-cell subsets that were inverse correlates of HIV infection risk.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-02-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Rapidly progressing particle tracking techniques have revealed that foreign particles in biological fluids exhibit rich and at times unexpected behavior, with important consequences for disease diagnosis and drug delivery. Yet, there remains a frustrating lack of coherence in the description of these particles&amp;rsquo; motion. Largely this is due to a reliance on functional statistics (e.g., mean-squared displacement) to perform model selection and assess goodness-of-fit.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-02-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: High-dimensional statistics is the basis for analyzing large and complex data sets that are generated by cutting-edge technologies in genetics, neuroscience, astronomy, and many other fields. However, Lasso, Ridge Regression, Graphical Lasso, and other standard methods in high-dimensional statistics depend on tuning parameters that are difficult to calibrate in practice. In this talk, I present two novel approaches to overcome this difficulty. My first approach is based on a novel testing scheme that is inspired by Lepski’s idea for bandwidth selection in non-parametric statistics.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-02-05 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1B39 Abstract: We consider a class of group-lasso learning problems where the objective function is the sum of an empirical loss and the group-lasso penalty. For a class of loss function satisfying a quadratic majorization condition, we derive a unified algorithm called groupwise-majorization-descent (GMD) for efficiently computing the solution paths of the corresponding group-lasso penalized learning problem. GMD allows for general design matrices, without requiring the predictors to be group-wise orthonormal.</description>

Unlike intensity-based or frailty-based approaches to joint modeling, the copula formulation proposed herein ensures that a wide range of marginal multi-state processes can be specified and the joint model will retain these marginal features. The copula formulation also facilitates a variety of approaches to estimation and inference including composite likelihood and two-stage estimation procedures.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-01-30 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: We address two outstanding challenges in sparse regression: (i) computationally efficient estimation in distributed settings; (ii) valid inference for the selected coefficients. The main computational challenge in a distributed setting is harnessing the computational capabilities of all the machines while keeping communication costs low. We devise an approach that requires only a single round of communication among the machines. We show the approach recovers the convergence rate of the (centralized) lasso as long as each machine has access to an adequate number of samples.</description>

The main idea is to establish an asymptotic equivalence in Le Cam’s sense between an experiment which simultaneously describes these realizations and a collection of white noise models. In this context, we project onto an arbitrary basis and apply a novel variant of Stein-type estimation for optimal recovery of the realized trajectories.</description>

      <description>Date: 2015-01-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A mixture of coalesced generalized hyperbolic distributions is developed by joining a finite mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions with a mixture of multiple scaled generalized hyperbolic distributions. The result is a mixture of mixtures with shared model parameters and common mode. We begin by discussing the generalized hyperbolic distribution, which has the t, Gaussian and others as special cases. The generalized hyperbolic distribution can represented as a normal-variance mixture using a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution.</description>

Chen &amp;amp; Fan (2005) proposed a model selection method involving a statistical hypothesis test. The hypothesis test attempts to take into account the randomness of the AIC and other likelihood-based model selection methods for finite samples. Performance of the test compared to the more common approach of AIC is illustrated in a series of simulations.</description>

The model is often assumed to be a finite mixture of multivariate normal distributions; however, flexible extensions have been developed over recent years. This talk demonstrates some methods employed in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised classification that include skew-normal and skew-t mixture models. Both real and simulated data sets are used to demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques.</description>

      <description>Date: 2014-11-21 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Many statistical estimators are based on solving nonconvex programs. Although the practical performance of such methods is often excellent, the associated theory is frequently incomplete, due to the potential gaps between global and local optima. In this talk, we present theoretical results that apply to all local optima of various regularized M-estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex.</description>

      <description>Date: 2014-11-14 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In the parametric setting, the notion of a likelihood function forms the basis for the development of tests of hypotheses and estimation of parameters. Tests in connection with the analysis of variance stem entirely from considerations of the likelihood function. On the other hand, non- parametric procedures have generally been derived without any formal mechanism and are often the result of clever intuition.</description>

A B-spline basis is used to model the regression function. The smoothness of the regression function is controlled by the order of the B-splines and the shape is controlled by the shape of an associated control polygon. Controlling the shape of the control polygon reduces to some inequality constraints on the spline coefficients.</description>

The model consists of a tree structure, bivariate copulas, and marginal distributions. The construction relies on a conditional independence assumption whose implications are studied. Selection the tree structure, estimation and model validation are illustrated using data from a Canadian property and casualty insurance company.

      <description>Date: 2014-10-24 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a technology revolutionizing genetics and biology. Compared with the old Sanger sequencing method, the throughput is astounding and has fostered a slew of innovative sequencing applications. Unfortunately, the error rates are also higher, complicating many downstream analyses. For example, de novo assembly of genomes is less accurate and slower when reads include many errors. We develop a probabilistic model for NGS reads that can detect and correct errors without a reference genome and while flexibly modeling and estimating the error properties of the sequencing machine.</description>

      <description>Date: 2014-10-17 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In the recent past, electronic health records and distributed data networks emerged as a viable resource for medical and scientific research. As the use of confidential patient information from such sources become more common, maintaining privacy of patients is of utmost importance. For a binary disease outcome of interest, we show that the techniques of specimen pooling could be applied for analysis of large and/or distributed data while respecting patient privacy.</description>

This is especially true when identifying spatial dependencies between quantitative extremes like heavy rainfall. The paper of Bernard et al. (2013) develops a fast and simple clustering algorithm for finding spatial patterns appropriate for extremes. They develop their algorithm by adapting multivariate extreme-value theory to the context of spatial clustering.</description>

      <description>Date: 2014-09-26 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In palliative care studies, the primary outcomes are often health related quality of life measures (HRLQ). Randomized trials and prospective cohorts typically recruit patients with advanced stage of disease and follow them until death or end of the study. An important feature of such studies is that, by design, some patients, but not all, are likely to die during the course of the study.</description>

Sometimes the data may be incomplete for reasons beyond the control of the experimenter. However, it is also possible that this missingness is part of the study design. By using a two-phase sampling approach where only a small sub-sample gives complete information, it is possible to greatly reduce the cost of a study and still obtain precise estimates.</description>

We will consider two problems regarding a sequence of random variables with a given common marginal distribution. First, we will introduce the notion of extreme negative dependence (END), a new benchmark for negative dependence, which is comparable to comonotonicity and independence. Second, we will study the compatibility of the marginal distribution and the limiting distribution when the dependence structure in the sequence is allowed to vary among all possibilities.</description>

      <description>Date: 2014-02-21 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Nerve cells (a.k.a. neurons) communicate via electrochemical waves (action potentials), which are usually called spikes as they are very localized in time. A sequence of consecutive spikes from one neuron is called a spike train. The exact mechanism of information coding in spike trains is still an open problem; however, one popular approach is to model spikes as realizations of an inhomogeneous Poisson process.</description>

A key aspect of this alternative approach requires specication of a parametric family, which is usually not feasible in the context of problems involving complex data structures wherein estimating equations are typically used for inference.</description>

The asymptotic properties of this estimator are investigated under a multivariate exchangeable cdf. Two applications of the proposed statistic are considered.

This lead to the development of stochastic analysis, a field which includes the study of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). One of the approaches for the study of SPDEs was initiated by Walsh (1986) and relies on the concept of random-field solution for equations perturbed by a space-time white noise (or Brownian sheet).</description>

It can account for a wide range of dependence, ranging from tail positive dependence to tail negative dependence. We will introduce theory and applications of tail order. Conditions for tail orders of copula families will be discussed, and they are helpful in guiding us to find suitable copula families for statistical inference.</description>

In the context of two competing models where one model includes all predictors and the other restricts variable coefficients to a candidate linear subspace based on subject matter or prior knowledge, we investigate the relative performances of Stein type shrinkage, pretest, and penalty estimators (L1GLM, adaptive L1GLM, and SCAD) with respect to the full model estimator.</description>

Item Response Theory (IRT) provides a set of tools for examining the properties of the instrument and for estimation of the latent trait for each individual. In my research, I critically examine the usefulness of the summed score over items and an alternative weighted summed score (using weights computed from the IRT model) as an alternative to both the empirical Bayes estimator and maximum likelihood estimator for the Generalized Partial Credit Model.</description>

The proposed method models both continuous and binary phenotypes, and it accounts for serial and familial correlations when longitudinal and pedigree data have been collected.

In particular, small area estimation has been extensively studied under linear mixed models. However, in practice there are many situations that we have counts or proportions in small area estimation; for example a (monthly) dataset on the number of incidences in small areas. Recently, small area estimation under the linear mixed model with penalized spline model, for xed part of the model, was studied.</description>

The test is based on a statistic of the Cramér–von Mises type constructed from the so-called empirical checkerboard copula. The test can be used even for sparse contingency tables or tables whose dimension changes with the sample size. Because the limiting distribution of the test statistic is not tractable, a valid bootstrap procedure for the computation of p-values will be discussed.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-09-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A new density estimation method in a Bayesian nonparametric framework is presented when recorded data are not coming directly from the distribution of interest, but from a length biased version. From a Bayesian perspective, efforts to computationally evaluate posterior quantities conditionally on length biased data were hindered by the inability to circumvent the problem of a normalizing constant. In this talk a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to the length bias sampling problem is presented which circumvents the issue of the normalizing constant.</description>

The principal situation analyzed relates to the estimation of an unknown predictive p-variate normal density based on an observation generated by another p-variate normal density. The means of the densities are assumed to coincide, the covariance matrices are a known multiple of the identity matrix.</description>

Population quantiles and their functions are important parameters in many applications. For example, the lower level quantiles often serve as crucial quality indices of forestry products and others. In the presence of several independent samples from populations satisfying density ratio model, we investigate the properties of the empirical likelihood (EL) based inferences of quantiles and their functions.</description>

In this talk, we consider a class of extremal problems that is closely connected to the problem of testing multivariate independence. By solving the extremal problem, we provide a unified approach to establishing weak convergence for a wide class of empirical processes which emerge in connection with testing multivariate independence.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-02-15 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: It is often crucial to know whether the dependence structure of a bivariate distribution belongs to the class of extreme-­‐value copulas. In this talk, I will describe a graphical tool that allows judgment regarding the existence of extreme-­‐value dependence. I will also present a data-­‐ driven nonparametric estimator of the Pickands dependence function. This estimator, which is constructed from constrained b-­‐splines, is intrinsic and differentiable, thereby enabling sampling from the fitted model.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-02-08 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In the context of univariate association tests between a trait of interest and common genetic variants (SNPs) across the whole genome, corrections for multiple testing have been well-studied. Due to the patterns of correlation (i.e. linkage disequilibrium), the number of independent tests remains close to 1 million, even when many more common genetic markers are available. With the advent of the DNA sequencing era, however, newly-identified genetic variants tend to be rare or even unique, and consequently single-variant tests of association have little power.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-02-01 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: I will consider the task of estimating high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models (or networks) corresponding to a single set of features under several distinct conditions. In other words, I wish to estimate several distinct but related networks. I assume that most aspects of the networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences between them. The goal is to exploit the similarity among the networks in order to obtain more accurate estimates of each individual network, as well as to identify the differences between the networks.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-01-25 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In an attempt to improve on the Metropolis algorithm, various MCMC methods with auxiliary variables, such as the multiple-try and delayed rejection Metropolis algorithms, have been proposed. These methods generate several candidates in a single iteration; accordingly they are computationally more intensive than the Metropolis algorithm. It is usually difficult to provide a general estimate for the computational cost of a method without being overly conservative; potentially efficient methods could thus be overlooked by relying on such estimates.</description>

      <description>Date: 2013-01-11 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Statisticians are often faced with budget concerns when conducting studies. The collection of some covariates, such as genetic data, is very expensive. Other covariates, such as detailed histories, might be difficult or time-consuming to measure. This helped bring about the invention of the nested case-control study, and its more generalized version, risk-set sampled survival analysis. The literature has a good discussion of the properties of risk-set sampling in standard right-censored survival data.</description>

In such cases, it is often of interest to reject either all hypotheses or at least one of them. More generally, the question arises as to whether one can reject at least r out of m hypotheses. Statistical tools addressing this issue are rare in the literature.</description>

To satisfy these two conflicting objectives, agencies use various techniques to restrict and modify the data before publication. Most of these techniques however share a common flaw: their confidentiality protection can not be rigorously measured. In this talk, I will present the criterion of differential privacy, a rigorous measure of the protection offered by such methods.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-11-16 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In this paper we investigate a new approach of estimating a regression function based on copulas. The main idea behind this approach is to write the regression function in terms of a copula and marginal distributions. Once the copula and the marginal distributions are estimated we use the plug-in method to construct the new estimator. Because various methods are available in the literature for estimating both a copula and a distribution, this idea provides a rich and flexible alternative to many existing regression estimators.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-11-09 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Assessing tail risks using the asymptotic models provided by multivariate extreme value theory has the danger that when asymptotic independence is present (as with the Gaussian copula model), the asymptotic model provides estimates of probabilities of joint tail regions that are zero. In diverse applications such as finance, telecommunications, insurance and environmental science, it may be difficult to believe in the absence of risk contagion.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-11-02 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Estimating extreme risks in a multivariate framework is highly connected with the estimation of the extremal dependence structure. This structure can be described via the stable tail dependence function L, for which several estimators have been introduced. Asymptotic normality is available for empirical estimates of L, with rate of convergence k^1/2, where k denotes the number of high order statistics used in the estimation.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-10-26 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Computer simulators are used widely to describe physical processes in lieu of physical observations. In some cases, more than one computer code can be used to explore the same physical system - each with different degrees of fidelity. In this work, we combine field observations and model runs from deterministic multi-fidelity computer simulators to build a predictive model for the real process. The resulting model can be used to perform sensitivity analysis for the system and make predictions with associated measures of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-10-12 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Extreme Value Theory has been widely used for assessing risk for highly unusual events, either by using block maxima or peaks over the threshold (POT) methods. However, one of the main drawbacks of the POT method is the choice of a threshold, which plays an important role in the estimation since the parameter estimates strongly depend on this value. Bayesian inference is an alternative to handle these difficulties; the threshold can be treated as another parameter in the estimation, avoiding the classical empirical approach.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-10-05 Time: 14:30-15:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Using only bivariate copulas as building blocks, regular vines(R-vines) constitute a flexible class of high-dimensional dependence models. In this talk we introduce a Markov switching R-vine copula model, combining the flexibility of general R-vine copulas with the possibility for dependence structures to change over time. Frequentist as well as Bayesian parameter estimation is discussed. Further, we apply the newly proposed model to examine the dependence of exchange rates as well as stock and stock index returns.</description>

Such strategy has been widely employed in applications ranging from genetics, information technology, marketing, to finance. Studying the mixing structure behind a random sample from the population allows us to infer the degree of heterogeneity with important implications in applications such as the presence of disease subgroups in genetics.</description>

The most commonly applied of these frameworks is due to Prentice (1989), who proposed a set of criteria which a surrogate marker should satisfy.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-03-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Model selection is of fundamental importance to high-dimensional modeling featured in many contemporary applications. Classical principles of model selection include the Bayesian principle and the Kullback-Leibler divergence principle, which lead to the Bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion, respectively, when models are correctly specified. Yet model misspecification is unavoidable in practice. We derive novel asymptotic expansions of the two well-known principles in misspecified generalized linear models, which give the generalized BIC (GBIC) and generalized AIC.</description>

These measurements (responses) are bound to be influenced by subject specific covariates and if a regression model is used the data analyst is faced with the problem of selecting those covariates that “best explain” the data. For example, in a clinical trial, subjects may be monitored for a response following the administration of a treatment with a view of selecting the covariates that are best predictive of a treatment response.</description>

However, the dimensionality of functional observations often exceeds the sample size available to estimate σ(s,t, and then the analogue S of the multivariate sample estimate is singular and non-invertible.</description>

The problem of estimating the number of hidden states of the HMM is thus brought to the forefront. In this talk, we present a penalized quasi-likelihood approach for order estimation in HMMs which makes use of the fact that the marginal distribution of the observations from a HMM is a finite mixture model.</description>

One complicating factor in the analysis of such data is that samples are sometimes obtained from a population with significant underlying heterogeneity, which would be hard to capture by a single LME model. Such problems may be addressed by a finite mixture of linear mixed-effects (FMLME) models, which segments the population into subpopulations and models each subpopulation by a distinct LME model.</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-01-27 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A common problem in observational studies is estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatment in the presence of a time varying confounder. When random assignment of subjects to comparison groups is not possible, time-varying confounders can cause bias in estimating causal effects even after standard regression adjustment if past treatment history is a predictor of future confounders. To eliminate the bias of standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time varying treatment, Robins developed a number of innovative methods for discrete treatment levels, including G-computation, G-estimation, and marginal structural models (MSMs).</description>

      <description>Date: 2012-01-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Latent variable mixture models are a powerful tool for exploring the structure in large datasets. A common challenge for interpreting such models is a desire to impose sparsity, the natural assumption that each data point only contains few latent features. Since mixture distributions are constrained in their L1 norm, typical sparsity techniques based on L1 regularization become toothless, and concave regularization becomes necessary.</description>

A path-dependent estimator for the distribution is proposed; among other properties, the estimator is sequential in the sense that it only uses data preceding any fixed point at which it is evaluated.</description>

For policy decision making, it is important to rely on an accurate estimate of the real crash risk of cell phone use while driving. Three important epidemiological studies were published on the subject, two using the case-crossover approach and one using a more conventional longitudinal cohort design.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-11-18 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: The diagonal expansion of a bivariate distribution (Lancaster, 1958) has been used as a tool to construct bivariate distributions; this method has been generalized using principal dimensions of random variables (Cuadras 2002). Sufficient and necessary conditions are given for uniform, exponential, logistic and Pareto marginals in the one and two-dimensional case. The corresponding copulas are obtained.

      <description>Date: 2011-11-04 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Diffusion processes have been used to model a multitude of continuous-time phenomena in Engineering and the Natural Sciences, and as in this case, the volatility of financial assets. However, parametric inference has long been complicated by an intractable likelihood function. For many models the most effective solution involves a large amount of missing data for which the typical Gibbs sampler can be arbitrarily slow.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-11-03 Time: 16:00-17:00 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: This talk is concerned with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in exponential statistical models for networks (random graphs) and, in particular, with the beta model, a simple model for undirected graphs in which the degree sequence is the minimal sufficient statistic. The speaker will present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the MLE of the beta model parameters that are based on a geometric object known as the polytope of degree sequences.</description>

      <title>Simulated method of moments estimation for copula-based multivariate models</title>

      <description>Date: 2011-10-28 Time: 15:00-16:00 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: This paper considers the estimation of the parameters of a copula via a simulated method of moments type approach. This approach is attractive when the likelihood of the copula model is not known in closed form, or when the researcher has a set of dependence measures or other functionals of the copula, such as pricing errors, that are of particular interest. The proposed approach naturally also nests method of moments and generalized method of moments estimators.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-10-21 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify physical positions (loci) on the genome where genetic variation is causally associated with a phenotype of interest at the population level. Typical studies are based on the measurement of several hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants spread across the genome, in a few thousand individuals. The resulting datasets are large and require computationally efficient methods of statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-09-30 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Streaming data is ubiquitous in a wide range of areas from engineering and information technology, finance, and commerce, to atmospheric physics, and earth sciences. The online approximation of properties of data streams is of great interest, but this approximation process is hindered by the sheer size of the data and the speed at which it is generated. Data stream algorithms typically allow only one pass over the data, and maintain sub-linear representations of the data from which target properties can be inferred with high efficiency.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-09-23 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In this talk, we give a basic introduction to Sumio Watanabe&amp;rsquo;s Singular Learning Theory, as outlined in his book &amp;ldquo;Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory&amp;rdquo;. Watanabe&amp;rsquo;s key insight to studying singular models was to use a deep result in algebraic geometry known as Hironaka&amp;rsquo;s Resolution of Singularities. This result allows him to reparametrize the model in a normal form so that central limit theorems can be applied.</description>

      <description>Date: 2011-09-16 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Pair-copula constructions (PCCs) provide an elegant way to construct highly flexible multivariate distributions. However, for convenience of inference, pair-copulas are often assumed to depend on the conditioning variables only indirectly. In this talk, I will show how nonparametric smoothing techniques can be used to avoid this assumption. Model selection for PCCs will also be addressed within the proposed method.

      <description>Date: 2011-08-31 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Volume estimators based on Cavalieri’s principle are widely used in the bio- sciences. For example in neuroscience, where volumetric measurements of brain structures are of interest, systematic samples of serial sections are obtained by magnetic resonance imaging or by a physical cutting procedure. The volume v is then estimated by ˆv, which is the sum over the areas of the structure of interest in the section planes multiplied by the width of the sections, t &amp;gt; 0.</description>
