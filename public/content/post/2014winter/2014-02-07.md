## Abstract:

	
	
While computed tomography and other imaging techniques are measured in absolute units with physical meaning, magnetic resonance images are expressed in arbitrary units that are difficult to interpret and differ between study visits and subjects. Much work in the image processing literature has centered on histogram matching and other histogram mapping techniques, but little focus has been on normalizing images to have biologically interpretable units. We explore this key goal for statistical analysis and the impact of normalization on cross-sectional and longitudinal segmentation of pathology.
