## Abstract:

	
Finite mixture models provide a natural framework for analyzing data from heterogeneous populations. In practice, however, the number of hidden subpopulations in the data may be unknown. The problem of estimating the order of a mixture model, namely the number of subpopulations, is thus crucial for many applications. In this talk, we present a new penalized likelihood solution to this problem, which is applicable to models with a multidimensional parameter space. The order of the model is estimated by starting with a large number of mixture components, which are clustered and then merged via two penalty functions. Doing so estimates the unknown parameters of the mixture, at the same time as the order. We will present extensive simulation studies, showing our approach outperforms many of the most common methods for this problem, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion. Real data examples involving normal and multinomial mixtures further illustrate its performance.
