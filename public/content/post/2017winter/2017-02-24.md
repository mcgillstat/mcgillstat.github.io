## Abstract:

	
This talk will provide an introduction to the first of the pillars in Stephen Stigler's 2016 book The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom, namely “Aggregation.” It will focus on early instances of the sample mean in scientific work, on the early error distributions, and on how their “centres” were fitted.
