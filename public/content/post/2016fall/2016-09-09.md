## Abstract:

	
Goria and Flury (Definition 2.1, 1996) proposed the two-set canonical variate model (referred to as the CV-2 model hereafter) and its extension in multiple populations with invariant weight coefficients (Definition 2.2). The equality constraints imposed on the weight coefficients are in line with the approach to interpreting the canonical variates (i.e., the linear combinations of original variables) advocated by Harris (1975, 1989), Rencher (1988, 1992), and Rencher and Christensen (2003). However, the literature in psychology and education shows that the standard approach adopted by most researchers, including Anderson (2003), is to use the canonical loadings (i.e., the correlations between the canonical variates and the original variables in the same set) to interpret the canonical variates. In case of multicollinearity (giving rise to the so-called suppression effects) among the original variables, it is not uncommon to obtain different interpretations from the two approaches. Therefore, following the standard approach in practice, an alternative (probably more realistic) extension of Goria and Flury’s CV-2 model in multiple populations is to impose the equality constraints on the canonical loadings. The utility of this multiple-population extension are illustrated with two numeric examples.
