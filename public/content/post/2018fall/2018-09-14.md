## Abstract:

Nonparametric models are popular modeling tools because of their natural overall flexibility. In our
approach, we apply nonparametric techniques for panel data structures with changepoints and optional
shape constraints and the estimation is performed in a fully data driven manner by utilizing atomic pursuit
methods â€“ LASSO regularization techniques in particular. However, in order to obtain robust estimates
and, also, to have a more complex insight into the underlying data structure, we target conditional
quantiles rather then the conditional mean only. The whole estimation process and the following inference
become both more challenging but the results are more useful in practical applications. The underlying
model is firstly introduced and some theoretical results are presented. The proposed methodology is
applied for a real data scenario and some finite sample properties are investigated via an extensive
simulation study. This is a joint work with Ivan Mizera, University of Alberta and Gabriela Ciuperca, University of Lyon
