## Abstract:

In this paper we investigate a new approach of estimating a regression function based on copulas. The main idea behind this approach is to write the regression function in terms of a copula and marginal distributions. Once the copula and the marginal distributions are estimated we use the plug-in method to construct the new estimator. Because various methods are available in the literature for estimating both a copula and a distribution, this idea provides a rich and flexible alternative to many existing regression estimators. We provide some asymptotic results related to this copula-based regression modeling when the copula is estimated via profile likelihood and the marginals are estimated nonparametrically. We also study the finite sample performance of the estimator and illustrate its usefulness by analyzing data from air pollution studies.
