## Abstract:

	
	
In this talk, I will provide an introduction to DTRs and an overview the state of the art (and science) of Q-learning, a popular tool in reinforcement learning. The use of Q-learning and its variance in randomized and non-randomized studies will be discussed, as well as issues concerning inference as the resulting estimators are not always regular. Current and future directions of interest will also be considered.
