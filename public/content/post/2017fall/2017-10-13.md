## Abstract:

	
In various applications, evaluating spatial risks (such as floods, heatwaves or storms) is a key problem. The aim of this talk is to make use of extreme value theory and max-stable processes to provide quantitative answers to this issue. A review of the literature will be provided, as well as a wide comparative study based on a simulation design mimicking daily rainfall in France. This is a joint work with Cécile Mercadier (Université Claude-Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL)) and Quentin Sebille (UCBL).



## Speaker


Anne-Laure Fougères is Professor of Statistics at the Institut Camille-Jordan, Université Claude-Bernard, Lyon, France.
