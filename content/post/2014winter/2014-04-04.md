## Abstract:


	
Statisticians working in most federal agencies are often faced with two conflicting objectives: (1) collect and publish useful datasets for designing public policies and building scientific theories, and (2) protect confidentiality of data respondents which is essential to uphold public trust, leading to better response rates and data accuracy. In this talk I will provide a survey of two statistical methods currently used at the U.S. Census Bureau: synthetic data and noise perturbed data.
