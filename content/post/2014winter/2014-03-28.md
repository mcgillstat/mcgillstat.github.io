## Abstract:

In this talk, we will look at some classical problems from an anti-traditional perspective. We will consider two problems regarding a sequence of random variables with a given common marginal distribution. First, we will introduce the notion of extreme negative dependence (END), a new benchmark for negative dependence, which is comparable to comonotonicity and independence. Second, we will study the compatibility of the marginal distribution and the limiting distribution when the dependence structure in the sequence is allowed to vary among all possibilities. The results are somewhat simple, yet surprising. We will provide some interpretation and applications of the theoretical results in financial risk management, with the hope to deliver the following message: with the common marginal distribution known and dependence structure unknown, we know essentially nothing about the asymptotic shape of the sum of random variables.
