## Abstract:

	
In this talk, we investigate the problem of estimating high-dimensional networks in which there are a few highly connected â€œhub" nodes. Methods based on L1-regularization have been widely used for performing sparse selection in the graphical modelling context. However, the L1 penalty penalizes each edge equally and independently of each other without taking into account any structural information. We introduce a new method for estimating undirected graphical models with hubs, called the hubs weighted graphical lasso (HWGL). This is a two-step procedure with a hub screening step, followed by network reconstruction in the second step using a weighted lasso approach that incorporates the inferred network topology. Empirically, we show that the HWGL outperforms competing methods and illustrate the methodology with an application to microbiome data.
