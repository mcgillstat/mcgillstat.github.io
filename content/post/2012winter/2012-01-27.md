## Abstract:

	
A common problem in observational studies is estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatment in the presence of a time varying confounder.  When random assignment of subjects to comparison groups is not possible, time-varying confounders can cause bias in estimating causal effects even after standard regression adjustment if past treatment history is a predictor of future confounders. To eliminate the bias of standard methods for estimating the causal effect of time varying treatment, Robins developed a number of innovative methods for discrete treatment levels, including G-computation, G-estimation, and marginal structural models (MSMs).   However, there does not currently exist straight-forward applications of G-Estimation and MSMs for continuous treatment.  In this talk, I will introduce an alternative approach to previous methods which utilize the Kalman filter. The key advantage to the Kalman filter approach is that the model easily accommodates continuous levels of treatment.
