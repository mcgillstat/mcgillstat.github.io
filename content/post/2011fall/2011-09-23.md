## Abstract:

In this talk, we give a basic introduction to Sumio Watanabe's
Singular Learning Theory, as outlined in his book "Algebraic Geometry
and Statistical Learning Theory". Watanabe's key insight to studying
singular models was to use a deep result in algebraic geometry known
as Hironaka's Resolution of Singularities. This result allows him to
reparametrize the model in a normal form so that central limit
theorems can be applied. In the second half of the talk, we discuss
new algebraic methods where we define fiber ideals for discrete/Gaussian models. We show that the key to understanding the singular model lies in monomializing its fiber ideal.
