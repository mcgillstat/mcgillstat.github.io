## Abstract:

	
The use of cell phone while driving raises the question of whether it is associated with an increased collision risk and if so, what is its magnitude. For policy decision making, it is important to rely on an accurate estimate of the real crash risk of cell phone use while driving. Three important epidemiological studies were published on the subject, two using the case-crossover approach  and one using a more conventional longitudinal cohort design. The methodology and results of these studies will be presented and discussed.
