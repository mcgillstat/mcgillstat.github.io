## Abstract:

	
The ability for a computer to converse in a natural and coherent manner with a human has long been held as one of the important steps towards solving artificial intelligence. In this talk I will present recent results on building dialogue systems from large corpuses using deep neural architectures. I will highlight several challenges related to data acquisition, algorithmic development, and performance evaluation.
