## Abstract:

Given the discouraging state of current efforts to curb global warming, we can imagine that we will soon turn our attention to mitigation. On a global scale, distressed populations will turn to national and international organizations for solutions to dramatic problems caused by climate change. These institutions in turn will mandate the collection of data on a scale and resolution that will present extraordinary statistical and computational challenges to those of us viewed as having the appropriate expertise. A review of the current state of our space-time data analysis machinery suggests that we have much to do. Most of current spatial modelling methodology is based on concepts translated from time series analysis, is heavily dependent on various kinds of stationarity assumptions, uses the Gaussian distribution to model data and depends on a priori coordinate systems that do not exist in nature. A way forward from this restrictive framework is proposed by modelling data over textured domains using layered coordinate systems.
