## Abstract:

	
I will talk about COMPASS, a new Bayesian hierarchical framework for characterizing functional differences in antigen-specific T cells by leveraging high-throughput, single-cell flow cytometry data. In particular, I will illustrate, using a variety of data sets, how COMPASS can reveal subtle and complex changes in antigen-specific T-cell activation profiles that correlate with biological endpoints. Applying COMPASS to data from the RV144 (“the Thai trial”) HIV clinical trial, it identified novel T-cell subsets that were inverse correlates of HIV infection risk. I also developed intuitive metrics for summarizing multivariate antigen-specific T-cell activation profiles for endpoints analysis. In addition, COMPASS identified correlates of latent infection in an immune study of Tuberculosis among South African adolescents. COMPASS is available as an R package and is sufficiently general that it can be adapted to new high-throughput data types, such as Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell gene expressions, enabling interdisciplinary collaboration, which I will also highlight in my talk.
