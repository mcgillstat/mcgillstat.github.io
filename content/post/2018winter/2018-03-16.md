## Abstract:

	
Over the last decade, advances in measurement technologies has enabled researchers to generate multiple types of high-dimensional "omics" datasets for large cohorts. These data provide an opportunity to derive a mechanistic understanding of human complex traits. However, inferring meaningful biological relationships from these data is challenging due to high-dimensionality , noise, and abundance of confounding factors. In this talk, I'll describe statistical approaches for robust analysis of genomic data from large population studies, with a focus on 1) understanding the nature of confounding and approaches for addressing them and 2) understanding the genomic correlates of aging and dementia.
