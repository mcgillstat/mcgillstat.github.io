## Abstract:

The key determinant of the identity and behaviour of the cell is gene regulation, i.e. which genes are active and which genes are inactive in a particular cell. One of the least understood aspects of gene regulation is RNA stability: genes produce RNA molecules to carry their genetic information â€“ the more stable these RNA molecules are, the longer they can function within the cell, and the less stable they are, the more rapidly they are removed from the pool of active molecules. The cell can effectively switch the genes on and off by regulating RNA stability. However, we do not know which genes are regulated at the RNA stability level, and what factors affect their stability. The focus of our research is development of novel computational methods that enables the measurement of RNA stability and decay rate from functional genomics data, and inference of models that explain how human cells regulate RNA stability. We are particularly interested in how defects in regulation of RNA stability can lead to development and progression of various human diseases, such as cancer.
