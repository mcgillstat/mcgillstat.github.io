## Abstract:

Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as strains of tuberculosis that do not respond to at least the two most used anti-TB drugs. After diagnosis, the intensive treatment phase for MDR-TB involves taking several alternative antibiotics concurrently. The Collaborative Group for Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data in MDR-TB has assembled a large, fused dataset of over 30 observational studies comparing the effectiveness of 15 antibiotics. The particular challenges that we have considered in the analysis of this dataset are the large number of potential drug regimens, the resistance of MDR-TB strains to specific antibiotics, and the identifiability of a generalized parameter of interest though most drugs were not observed in all studies. In this talk, I describe causal inference theory and methodology that we have appropriated or developed for the estimation of treatment importance and relative effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens with a particular emphasis on targeted learning approaches
