## Abstract:

	
I will present a unified approach to the estimation of generalized sparse additive models in high dimensional regression problems. Our approach is based on combining structure-inducing and sparsity penalties in a single regression problem. It allows for the use of a large family of structure-inducing penalties: Those characterized by semi-norm constraints. This includes finite dimensional linear subspaces, sobolev and holder classes, classes with bounded total variation, among others. We give an efficient computational algorithm to fit this family of models that easily scales to thousands of observations and features. In addition we develop a framework for proving convergence bounds on these estimators; and show that our estimators converge at the minimax optimal rate under suitable conditions. We also compare the performance of existing methods in an empirical study and discuss directions for future work.
