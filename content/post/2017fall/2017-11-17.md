## Abstract:


Changepoint detection is a central problem in time series and genomic data. For some applications, it is natural to impose constraints on the directions of changes. One example is ChIP-seq data, for which adding an up-down constraint improves peak detection accuracy, but makes the optimization problem more complicated. In this talk I will explain how a recently proposed functional pruning algorithm can be generalized to solve such constrained changepoint detection problems. Our proposed log-linear time algorithm achieves state-of-the-art peak detection accuracy in a benchmark of several genomic data sets, and is orders of magnitude faster than our previous quadratic time algorithm. Our implementation is available as the PeakSegPDPA function in the PeakSegOptimal R package, https://cran.r-project.org/package=PeakSegOptimal
