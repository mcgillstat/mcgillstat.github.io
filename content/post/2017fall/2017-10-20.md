## Abstract:

Statistical optimization has generated quite some interest recently. It refers to the case where hidden and local convexity can be discovered in most cases for nonconvex problems, making polynomial algorithms possible. It relies on a careful analysis of the geometry near global optima. In this talk, I will explore this issue by focusing on sparse regression problems in high dimensions. A computational framework named iterative local adaptive majorize-minimization (I-LAMM) will be proposed to simultaneously control algorithmic complexity and statistical error. I-LAMM effectively turns the nonconvex penalized regression problem into a series of convex programs by utilizing the locally strong convexity of the problem when restricting the solution set in an L_1 cone. Computationally, we establish a phase transition phenomenon: it enjoys a linear rate of convergence after a sub-linear burn-in. Statistically, it provides solutions with optimal statistical errors. Extensions to robust regression will be discussed.
