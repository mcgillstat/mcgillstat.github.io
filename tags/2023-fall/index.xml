      <title>Doubly Robust Estimation under Covariate-induced Dependent Left Truncation</title>

      <description>Date: 2023-10-27 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: Online, retransmitted in Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/84195498572 Meeting ID: 841 9549 8572 Passcode: None Abstract: In prevalent cohort studies with follow-up, the time-to-event outcome is subject to left truncation leading to selection bias. For estimation of the distribution of time-to-event, conventional methods adjusting for left truncation tend to rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption that the truncation time and the event time are “independent&amp;quot; on the observed region.</description>

      <title>Neural network architectures for functional data analysis</title>

      <description>Date: 2023-10-20 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: In person, Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/89761165882 Meeting ID: 897 6116 5882 Passcode: None Abstract: Functional data is defined as any random variables that assume values in an infinite precision domain, such as time or space. In applications, this data is usually discretely observed at some regularly or irregularly-spaced points over the domain. In this talk, we discuss ways to adapt modern neural network architectures for the analysis of functional data.</description>

      <title>Distances on and between complex networks</title>

      <description>Date: 2023-10-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: Online, retransmitted in Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/83477865796 Meeting ID: 834 7786 5796 Passcode: None Abstract: Distance plays a pivotal role in statistics. Meanwhile, recent technologies and social networks have yielded large complex network data sets, which require customized statistical tools. From a mathematical viewpoint, these complex networks are graphs with non-trivial structures (in contrast to Erdös-Rényi graphs, for example). These networks are models of systemic phenomena and cases where individual-level analyses are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Doubly robust inference under possibly misspecified marginal structural Cox model</title>

This is because the estimand of causal hazard ratio assumes that the marginal structural Cox model holds, while the doubly robust estimating function requires the specification of an additional model for the conditional distribution of the time-to-event given treatment and covariates, both models unlikely to hold simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Detection of Multiple Influential Observations on Variable Selection for High-dimensional Data: New Perspective with an Application to Neurologic Signature of Physical Pain.</title>

However, the stochastic selection of a submodel from high-dimensional data where $p$ exceeds $n$ has become ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Three Myths About Causal Mediation</title>

For example, in a model where a cause influences its effect both indirectly via a mediator and directly via factors not included in the model, mediation techniques enable one to measure both direct and indirect effects.</description>
