      <description>Date: 2023-09-29 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: Online, retransmitted in Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/82440807026 Meeting ID: 824 4080 7026 Passcode: None Abstract: Doubly robust estimation under the marginal structural Cox model has been a challenge until recently due to the non-collapsibility of the Cox regression model. This is because the estimand of causal hazard ratio assumes that the marginal structural Cox model holds, while the doubly robust estimating function requires the specification of an additional model for the conditional distribution of the time-to-event given treatment and covariates, both models unlikely to hold simultaneously.</description>

      <description>Date: 2023-09-22 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: In person, Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/89374813252 Meeting ID: 893 7481 3252 Passcode: None Abstract: Influential diagnosis is an integral part of data analysis, of which most existing methodological frameworks presume a deterministic submodel and are designed for low-dimensional data (i.e., the number of predictors $p$ smaller than the sample size $n$). However, the stochastic selection of a submodel from high-dimensional data where $p$ exceeds $n$ has become ubiquitous.</description>

      <description>Date: 2023-09-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Location: Burnside 1104 https://mcgill.zoom.us/j/86404798712 Meeting ID: 864 0479 8712 Passcode: None Abstract: Causal mediation techniques are a means for identifying the degree to which a cause influences its effect along particular causal paths. For example, in a model where a cause influences its effect both indirectly via a mediator and directly via factors not included in the model, mediation techniques enable one to measure both direct and indirect effects.</description>
