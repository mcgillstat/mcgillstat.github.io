      <description>Date: 2021-02-19 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 843 0865 5572 Passcode: 690084 Abstract: We consider the joint estimation of regression parameters from multiple potentially heterogeneous data sources with correlated vector outcomes. The primary goal of this joint integrative analysis is to estimate covariate effects on all vector outcomes through a marginal regression model in a statistically and computationally efficient way. We present a general class of distributed estimators that can be implemented in a parallelized computational scheme.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones</title>

      <description>Date: 2021-02-12 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 939 8331 3215 Passcode: 096952 Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for understanding the role TCs play in the global climate system, yet that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Algorithm to Multi-armed Bandit Problem with High-dimensional Covariates</title>

      <description>Date: 2021-02-05 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 843 0865 5572 Passcode: 690084 Abstract: This work studies an important sequential decision making problem known as the multi-armed bandit problem with covariates. Under a linear bandit framework with high-dimensional covariates, we propose a general arm allocation algorithm that integrates both arm elimination and randomized assignment strategies. By employing a class of high-dimensional regression methods for coefficient estimation, the proposed algorithm is shown to have near optimal finite-time regret performance under a new study scope that requires neither a margin condition nor a reward gap condition for competitive arms.</description>

      <title>Small Area Estimation in Low- and Middle-Income Countries</title>

      <description>Date: 2021-01-29 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 939 8331 3215 Passcode: 096952 Abstract: The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is a key barometer of the health of a nation. Unfortunately, many people living in low- and middle-income countries are not covered by civil registration systems. This makes estimation of the U5MR, particularly at the subnational level, difficult. In this talk, I will describe models that have been developed to produce the official United Nations (UN) subnational U5MR estimates in 22 countries.</description>

      <description>Date: 2021-01-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 843 0865 5572 Passcode: 690084 Abstract: During the last decade, hundreds of machine learning methods have been developed for disease outcome prediction based on high-throughput genomics data. However, the quality of the input genomics features and the output clinical variables has been ignored in these algorithms. In this talk, I will introduce two studies that develop methods to learn more accurate molecular signatures and drug response values for cancer research.</description>
