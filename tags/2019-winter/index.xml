      <title>Causal Inference with Unmeasured Confounding: an Instrumental Variable Approach</title>

      <description>Date: 2019-02-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Causal inference is a challenging problem because causation cannot be established from observational data alone. Researchers typically rely on additional sources of information to infer causation from association. Such information may come from powerful designs such as randomization, or background knowledge such as information on all confounders. However, perfect designs or background knowledge required for establishing causality may not always be available in practice.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-02-08 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1104 Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally and ranks second in Canada, costing the Canadian economy over $20 billion every year. Despite the recent progress in CVD through prevention, lifestyle changes, and the use of biomedical treatments to improve survival rates and quality of life, there has been a lack in the integration of computer-aided engineering (CAE) in this field.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-02-01 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: A recent body of work, by myself and many others, aims to develop a statistical theory of network data for problems a single network is observed. Of the models studied in this area, graphon models are probably most widely known in statistics. I will explain the relationship between three aspects of this work: (1) Specific models, such as graphon models, graphex models, and edge-exchangeable graphs.</description>

      <title>Modern Non-Problems in Optimization: Applications to Statistics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>/post/2019winter/2019-01-25/</link>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-25 Time: 16:00-17:00 Location: BURN 920 Abstract: We have witnessed a lot of exciting development of data science in recent years. From the perspective of optimization, many modern data-science problems involve some basic ``non’’-properties that lack systematic treatment by the current approaches for the sake of the computation convenience. These non-properties include the coupling of the non-convexity, non-differentiability and non-determinism. In this talk, we present rigorous computational methods for solving two typical non-problems: the piecewise linear regression and the feed-forward deep neural network.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the information matrix and longitudinal data with change points</title>
      <link>/post/2019winter/2019-01-18/</link>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-18 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Non-singularity of the information matrix plays a key role in model identification and the asymptotic theory of statistics. For many statistical models, however, this condition seems virtually impossible to verify. An example of such models is a class of mixture models associated with multi-path change-point problems (MCP) which can model longitudinal data with change points. The MCP models are similar in nature to mixture-of-experts models in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Magic Cross-Validation Theory for Large-Margin Classification</title>

      <description>Date: 2019-01-11 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Cross-validation (CV) is perhaps the most widely used tool for tuning supervised machine learning algorithms in order to achieve better generalization error rate. In this paper, we focus on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for the support vector machine (SVM) and related algorithms. We first address two wide-spreading misconceptions on LOOCV. We show that LOOCV, ten-fold, and five-fold CV are actually well-matched in estimating the generalization error, and the computation speed of LOOCV is not necessarily slower than that of ten-fold and five-fold CV.</description>
