A standard assumption of these techniques is that individuals can be identified uniquely and without error, but this can be violated in many ways.  In some cases, it may not be possible to identify individuals uniquely because of the study design or the choice of marks.  Other times, errors may occur so that individuals are incorrectly identified.  I will discuss work with my collaborators over the past 10 ye ars developing methods to account for problems that arise when are only individuals are only partially identified.  I will present theoretical aspects of this research, including an introduction to the latent multinomial model and algebraic statistics, and also describe applications to studies of species ranging from the golden mantella (an endangered frog endemic to Madagascar measuring only 20 mm) to the whale shark (the largest known species of sh measuring up to 19 m).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The bundling feature naturally leads to longitudinal measurements of multiple insurance risks. We build a novel predictive model that actively exploits the dependence among the evolution of multivariate repeated risk measurements. Specifically, the longitudinal measurement of each individual risk is first modeled using pair copula construction with a D-vine structure, and the multiple D-vines are then integrated by a flexible copula. While our analysis mainly focuses on the claim count as the measurement of insurance risk, the proposed model indeed provides a unified modeling framework that can accommodate different scales of measurements, including continuous, discrete, and mixed observations. A computationally efficient sequential method is proposed for model estimation and inference, and its performance is investigated both theoretically and via simulation studies. In the application, we examine multivariate bundled risks in multi-peril property insurance using the proprietary data obtained from a commercial property insurance provider. The proposed predictive model is found to provide improved decision making for several key insurance operations, including risk segmentation and risk management. In the underwriting operation, we show that the experience rate priced by the proposed model leads to a 9% lift in the insurer&amp;rsquo;s profit. In the reinsurance operation, we show that the insurer underestimates the risk of the retained insurance portfolio by 10% when ignoring the dependence among bundled insurance risks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In variational Bayes (VB), a method from machine learning, one approximates the posterior through optimization, which is typically faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo. We study a mean-field (i.e. factorizable) VB approximation to Bayesian model selection priors, including the popular spike-and-slab prior, in sparse high-dimensional linear regression. We establish convergence rates for this VB approach, studying conditions under which it provides good estimation. We also discuss some computational issues and study the empirical performance of the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices. This fact, along with the highly technical nature of the industry standard reproducibility tools currently employed in data science, present out-ofthe gate challenges in teaching reproducibility in the data science classroom. Put simply, students are not as intrinsically motivated to learn this topic, and it is not an easy one for them to learn. What can a data science educator do? Over several iterations of teaching courses focused on reproducible data science tools and workflows, we have found that providing extra motivation, guided instruction and lots of practice are key to effectively teaching this challenging, yet important subject. Here we present examples of how we deeply motivate, effectively guide and provide ample practice opportunities to data science students to effectively engage them in learning about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To analyze them properly, we must address the fact that the treatment is assigned at the cluster level instead of the individual level. Standard analytic strategies are regressions based on individual data, cluster averages, and cluster totals, which differ when the cluster sizes vary. These methods are often motivated by models with strong and unverifiable assumptions, and the choice among them can be subjective. Without any outcome modeling assumption, we evaluate these regression estimators and the associated robust standard errors from a design-based perspective where only the treatment assignment itself is random and controlled by the experimenter. We demonstrate that regression based on cluster averages targets a weighted average treatment effect, regression based on individual data is suboptimal in terms of efficiency, and regression based on cluster totals is consistent and more efficient with a large number of clusters. We highlight the critical role of covariates in improving estimation efficiency, and illustrate the efficiency gain via both simulation studies and data analysis. Moreover, we show that the robust standard errors are convenient approximations to the true asymptotic standard errors under the design-based perspective. Our theory holds even when the outcome models are misspecified, so it is model-assisted rather than model-based. We also extend the theory to a wider class of weighted average treatment effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a simple illustrative dataset, we first demonstrate how the traditional tree-based algorithm&amp;rsquo;s splitting function fails to cope with a large proportion of data with zero responses. To address the imbalance issue presented in such loss modeling, this paper aims to modify the traditional splitting function of Classification and Regression Tree (CART). In particular, we propose two novel actuarial modified loss functions, namely, the weighted sum of squared error and the sum of squared Canberra error. These modified loss functions impose a significant penalty on grouping observations of non-zero response with those of zero response at the splitting procedure, and thus significantly enhance their separation. Finally, we examine and compare the predictive performance of such actuarial modified tree-based models to the traditional model on synthetic datasets that imitate insurance loss. The results show that such modification leads to substantially different tree structures and improved prediction performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unlike classical methods which are based on estimating the (limiting) distribution of an estimator, the HulC is often simpler to use and effectively bypasses this step. In comparison to the bootstrap, the HulC requires fewer regularity conditions and succeeds in many examples where the bootstrap provably fails. Unlike subsampling, the HulC does not require knowledge of the rate of convergence of the estimators on which it is based. The validity of the HulC requires knowledge of the (asymptotic) median-bias of the estimators. We further analyze a variant of our basic method, called the Adaptive HulC, which is fully data-driven and estimates the median-bias using subsampling. We show that the Adaptive HulC retains the aforementioned strengths of the HulC. In certain cases where the underlying estimators are pathologically asymmetric, the HulC and Adaptive HulC can fail to provide useful confidence sets. We discuss these methods in the context of several challenging inferential problems which arise in parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric inference. Although our focus is on validity under weak regularity conditions, we also provide some general results on the width of the HulC confidence sets, showing that in many cases the HulC confidence sets have near-optimal width.&#xA;Please let me know if you need anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Therefore, it seems that&#xA;for modern models the classical theory may be too conservative and strict.&#xA;In this talk, we consider the most popular procedure for regression&#xA;task, that is Empirical Risk Minimization with squared loss (ERM) and&#xA;we shall analyze its minimal squared error both in the random and the&#xA;fixed design settings, under the assumption of a convex family of functions.&#xA;Namely, the minimal squared error that the ERM attains on estimating&#xA;any function in our class in both settings.&#xA;In the fixed design setting, we show that the error is governed by&#xA;the global complexity of the entire class. In contrast, in random design,&#xA;the ERM may only adapt to simpler models if the local neighborhoods&#xA;around the regression function are nearly as complex as the class itself,&#xA;a somewhat counter-intuitive conclusion. We provide sharp lower bounds&#xA;for performance of ERM for both Donsker and non-Donsker classes. This&#xA;talk is based on joint work with Alexander Rakhlin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Classical empirical processes typically study the empirical distribution function over the real line, while more modern empirical processes study much more general indexing function classes (e.g., Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, smoothness class); typical results include moment bounds and deviation inequalities.  In this talk we will survey some of these results, but for the weighted empirical process that is obtained by weighing the original process by a factor related to the standard deviation of the process, which will make the resulting process more difficult to bound.  Applications to multivaraite rank order statistics and residual empirical processes will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
