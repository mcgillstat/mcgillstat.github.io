      <title>Adventures with Partial Identifications in Studies of Marked Individuals</title>

      <description>Date: 2021-11-26 Time: 15:30-16:30 (Montreal time) Zoom Link Meeting ID: 939 8331 3215 Passcode: 096952 Abstract: Monitoring marked individuals is a common strategy in studies of wild animals (referred to as mark-recapture or capture-recapture experiments) and hard to track human populations (referred to as multi-list methods or multiple-systems estimation). A standard assumption of these techniques is that individuals can be identified uniquely and without error, but this can be violated in many ways.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Bundled Insurance Risks with Dependence-aware Prediction using Pair Copula Construction</title>

The bundling feature naturally leads to longitudinal measurements of multiple insurance risks. We build a novel predictive model that actively exploits the dependence among the evolution of multivariate repeated risk measurements.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes for high-dimensional linear regression with sparse priors</title>

In variational Bayes (VB), a method from machine learning, one approximates the posterior through optimization, which is typically faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo. We study a mean-field (i.e. factorizable) VB approximation to Bayesian model selection priors, including the popular spike-and-slab prior, in sparse high-dimensional linear regression.</description>

While reproducibility is core to our definition, most data science learners enter the field with other aspects of data science in mind, for example predictive modelling, which is often one of the most interesting topic to novices.</description>

      <title>Model-assisted analyses of cluster-randomized experiments</title>

To analyze them properly, we must address the fact that the treatment is assigned at the cluster level instead of the individual level. Standard analytic strategies are regressions based on individual data, cluster averages, and cluster totals, which differ when the cluster sizes vary.</description>

      <title>Imbalanced learning using actuarial modified loss function in tree-based models</title>

With a simple illustrative dataset, we first demonstrate how the traditional tree-based algorithm&amp;rsquo;s splitting function fails to cope with a large proportion of data with zero responses.</description>

      <title>The HulC: Hull based Confidence Regions</title>

Unlike classical methods which are based on estimating the (limiting) distribution of an estimator, the HulC is often simpler to use and effectively bypasses this step. In comparison to the bootstrap, the HulC requires fewer regularity conditions and succeeds in many examples where the bootstrap provably fails.</description>

      <title>On the Minimal Error of Empirical Risk Minimization</title>

From the classical theory statistics point of view (the minimax theory), rich models tend to have a higher minimax rate, i.</description>

Classical empirical processes typically study the empirical distribution function over the real line, while more modern empirical processes study much more general indexing function classes (e.g., Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, smoothness class); typical results include moment bounds and deviation inequalities.</description>
