      <description>Date: 2019-11-15 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: Divergences, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are distance-like quantities which arise in many applications in probability, statistics and data science. We introduce a family of logarithmic divergences which is a non-linear extension of the celebrated Bregman divergence. It is defined for any exponentially concave function (a function whose exponential is concave). We motivate this divergence by mathematical finance and large deviations of Dirichlet process.</description>

      <description>Date: 2019-09-13 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In the current era of multi-omics and digital healthcare, we are facing unprecedented amount of data with tremendous opportunities to link molecular phenotypes with complex diseases. However, the lack of integrative statistical method hinders system-level interrogation of relevant disease-related pathways and the genetic implication in various healthcare outcome.
In this talk, I will present our current progress in mining genomics and healthcare data.</description>

      <title>MAPLE; Semiparametric Estimation and Variable Selection for Length-biased Data with Heavy Censoring</title>

      <description>Date: 2019-09-06 Time: 15:30-16:30 Location: BURN 1205 Abstract: In this talk, we discuss two problems of semiparametric estimation and variable selection for length-biased data with heavy censoring. The common feature of the proposed estimation procedures in the literature is that they only put probability mass on failure times. Under length-biased sampling, however, censoring is informative and failing to incorporate censored observations into estimation can lead to a substantial loss of efficiency.</description>
